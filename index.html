                <h2>Do cats know their name?</h2>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Morgana, the feline companion from Persona 5, is well aware of his name. In fact, he insists on being addressed as "Mona" and takes great pride in his identity. Much like real cats, he responds quite energetically when called by his preferred name.</p>

                <h2>Essential tips to raise healthy pets</h2>
                <p>Considering Morgana's robust health in the Metaverse, here are some essential tips inspired by him: Ensure your pet gets enough sleep, provide a balanced diet with Morgana's favorite fish snacks, and engage in regular exercise, preferably in a cat bus-shaped gym.</p>

                <h2>Why does my cat attack me?</h2>
                <p>While Morgana may not attack, he does get a bit feisty when someone questions his driving skills. Similarly, some real cats might become aggressive due to various reasons like fear, playfulness, or territorial instincts. Understanding their behavior is crucial for a harmonious relationship.</p>

                <h2>How to throw a birthday party for your cat</h2>
                <p>Planning a feline celebration? Take a cue from Morgana's birthday bash in the Phantom Thieves' hideout. Decorate with cat-themed accessories, serve Morgana's favorite sushi, and organize a catnip-filled treasure hunt. Don't forget the catchy jazz soundtrack for the purr-fect party atmosphere!</p>
